# Analytics Portfolio - Zarraf Afnan

## About Me
Welcome to my analytics portfolio! I'm a data analyst passionate about uncovering insights from complex datasets to drive informed decision-making. This repository showcases my analytical skills and technical expertise through real-world projects.

## Technical Skills
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI
- **Database Management**: SQL
- **Programming**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Statistical Analysis**: SAS
- **Data Processing**: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

## Featured Project: Los Angeles Crime Pattern Analysis

### Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of crime patterns in Los Angeles using official LAPD data from January 2023 to November 2024. The analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing crime occurrences to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policymakers.

**File**: `Final-submission.ipynb`

### Key Findings
- **Geographic Distribution**: Central area shows the highest number of reported crimes, while Foothill has the lowest
- **Crime Types**: Vehicle theft emerges as a predominant street crime
- **Investigation Status**: A significant proportion of cases remain unresolved (Investigation Cont: 32,082 cases)
- **Location Patterns**: Streets are the most common crime locations, with specific premises showing over 2,000 incidents

### Methodology
- **Data Source**: Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) official crime dataset
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled character encoding issues, renamed columns for clarity, removed incomplete records
- **Analysis Tools**: Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Visualization**: Created comprehensive charts and graphs to illustrate crime patterns

### Technologies Used
- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

### Running the Analysis

#### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

#### How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zarrafafnan/analytics-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd analytics-portfolio
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `Final-submission.ipynb` and run all cells to reproduce the analysis

#### Viewing the Notebook
You can also view the notebook directly on GitHub by clicking on the `Final-submission.ipynb` file above.

### Key Insights & Recommendations

1. **Resource Allocation**: Increase investigative resources to address the high number of unresolved cases
2. **Targeted Policing**: Focus street-level enforcement in high-crime areas, particularly Central district
3. **Vehicle Theft Prevention**: Implement public awareness campaigns about vehicle security
4. **Strategic Planning**: Use geographic crime distribution data for optimal patrol route planning

### Data Ethics & Methodology
- All data used is publicly available through official government channels
- Analysis maintains focus on patterns rather than individual cases
- Findings presented with appropriate context and limitations
