# ðŸš¨ Los Angeles Crime Analysis: Data-Driven Insights for Urban Safety

## Executive Summary
This project investigates crime patterns in Los Angeles using LAPD data from January to November 2023. The goal is to uncover actionable insights in whereâ€”and what typesâ€”crimes occur, helping recommend strategies for public safety improvement.

## Key Results
- Street crimes are the most prevalentâ€”nearly 1.5 times more frequent than single-family dwellings, and over double multi-family dwellings.
- Auto Theft (stolen vehicles) dominates street crimes by a large margin.
- Central LA is the most crime-heavy area, while Foothill is the least affected.
- Many cases remain unresolved: Most have the status "Investigation Continued" (32,000+ out of 37,000 cases).
- Victim gender and age show no strong trendsâ€”gender counts are similar; "age 0" victims likely indicate missing data, not infants.

## Methodology
- Cleaned and visualized LAPD open data (37,000 cases).
- Used Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Analyzed by location, premises, crime type, and status.
- Explored correlations with gender, age, and victim characteristicsâ€”no strong links found.
- Documented code and figures in Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.

## Business Recommendations
- Increase patrols and visibility in Central LA and on major street zones.
- Target public awareness for auto theft prevention.
- Resource more investigators to close pending cases.
- Periodic audit of unresolved or "in progress" cases for trends.

## Limitations & Next Steps
- Data only covers 11 months (Janâ€“Nov 2023).
- Only reported crimes, no external variables or context.
- Large population of "Victim Age = 0" due to missing/unclear data.
- Recommend future work: incorporate socioeconomic, environmental, and event data for deeper predictive modeling.
